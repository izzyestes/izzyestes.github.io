                <p>
                    "Time Remaining" is a collaboration with artist Lamorn. It is a part of his upcoming album and I'm so excited to be a part of it. That's all I can reveal for now!

                <h3><strong>It's Spreading</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    "It’s Spreading" is a statement piece about the effects of the COVID-19 virus on our mental states as well as on our country. It was made by taking clips from various news broadcasts and manipulating/rearranging the vocals using chopping, granular synthesis, and other methods, as well as the addition of other musical aspects. It’s not supposed to be very pleasant to listen to, because this virus has not been a pleasant part of anyone’s lives. My hope is that it captures the craziness of this time, as well as providing a bit of artistic relief to the listener.

                <h3><strong>Like I Know You</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    "Like I Know You" is an exploration of vocal editing and how normal vocal phrases can sound different when listened closely. I started with a recording of my vocals, which I then chopped up and turned into completely different sounds. I then added effects to the tracks, and this created an almost eerie feeling. It’s more of an art form than a song, but I hope it inspires a new view of the voice in the listener.
